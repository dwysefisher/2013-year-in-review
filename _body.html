		      <p>The four-story, 17,270-square-foot addition scheduled for completion in August 2014 will house a state-of-the-art organic and inorganic chemistry laboratory, a computer laboratory, classrooms, a tiered multimedia classroom, a study lounge, a conference room and faculty offices. The construction plan is designed to achieve certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) based on standards of the U.S. Green Buildings Council. CORE Construction of Morton is the general contractor. </p>
		      
		      <p>“With the construction of Sanders Hall, the broader community will benefit from the economic injection of capital in our rural region; the college’s science facilities will be state-of-the-art; and the instructional capacity will be expanded to handle expected growth in the student body and for STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – and other disciplines on our campus and throughout the region,” Arnold said. </p>
		      
		      <p>Classes from almost every academic division will be held in the building. Besides classes in science, computer science and mathematics, the building will accommodate classes in education, business, English, Spanish, sociology, psychology, communication, first-year and senior seminars and the academic honors program. </p>
		      
		      <p>Sanders Hall is the first classroom and laboratory building constructed on campus since Vennum-Binkley Science Hall was erected in 1916. The addition, which doubles the size of the original building, is part of an ongoing project to upgrade Vennum-Binkley Hall. </p>
		      
		      <p>Eureka College history professor emeritus Richard Sanders of Eureka donated $3 million toward the project. It is the largest single gift in Eureka College history.  Additionally, Eureka College trustees have pledged $1.5 million, according to Vice President of Development and Alumni Relations Michael Murtagh. </p>
		      
		      <p>“Eureka College is extremely pleased that funds for Sanders Hall have come exclusively from the generosity of individuals,” Murtagh said. “None of the funding has come from student tuition or fees or governmental aid.” </p>
		      
		      <p>The project is part of the Ivy Project: Historic Campus Constructions, which includes more than $15.7 million in recent new construction and renovations.</p>
