		<h3>Sanders Hall construction begins</h3>
		<h3 class="first-paragraph">On November 12, the college broke ground on Sanders Hall, a $6.7 million addition to the existing Vennum-Binkley Science Hall.</h3>

		    <div id="panel-readmore" class="content">
		      <p>The four-story, 17,270-square-foot addition scheduled for completion in August 2014 will house a state-of-the-art organic and inorganic chemistry laboratory, a computer laboratory, classrooms, a tiered multimedia classroom, a study lounge, a conference room and faculty offices. The construction plan is designed to achieve certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) based on standards of the U.S. Green Buildings Council. CORE Construction of Morton is the general contractor. </p>
		      
		      <p>"With the construction of Sanders Hall, the broader community will benefit from the economic injection of capital in our rural region; the college's science facilities will be state-of-the-art; and the instructional capacity will be expanded to handle expected growth in the student body and for STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – and other disciplines on our campus and throughout the region," Arnold said. </p>
		      
		      <p>Classes from almost every academic division will be held in the building. Besides classes in science, computer science and mathematics, the building will accommodate classes in education, business, English, Spanish, sociology, psychology, communication, first-year and senior seminars and the academic honors program. </p>
		      
		      <p>Sanders Hall is the first classroom and laboratory building constructed on campus since Vennum-Binkley Science Hall was erected in 1916. The addition, which doubles the size of the original building, is part of an ongoing project to upgrade Vennum-Binkley Hall. </p>
		      
		      <p>Eureka College history professor emeritus Richard Sanders of Eureka donated $3 million toward the project. It is the largest single gift in Eureka College history.  Additionally, Eureka College trustees have pledged $1.5 million, according to Vice President of Development and Alumni Relations Michael Murtagh. </p>
		      
		      <p>"Eureka College is extremely pleased that funds for Sanders Hall have come exclusively from the generosity of individuals," Murtagh said. "None of the funding has come from student tuition or fees or governmental aid." </p>
		      
		      <p>The project is part of the Ivy Project: Historic Campus Constructions, which includes more than $15.7 million in recent new construction and renovations.</p>

					<div id="panel-camino" class="content">
						<h4>&lsquo;It called me&rsquo;</h4>
						<h5>Junior Colton Lott walks Spain's 500-mile Camino de Santiago de Compostela</h5>
						<h6>by Colton Lott</h6>
<!--						<img src="<!-- @path colton-lott.jpg --*>" class="right centered inline-image" style="padding-left: 1em;" />-->
						<p class="right">Pilgrimage is an ancient practice developed in several religions, but one that Christianity at one time seemed at risk of losing. My generation, called the &ldquo;Millennials,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gen Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Selfie Generation,&rdquo; in between being bashed by generations more mature, has been taking interest in spiritual disciplines such as pilgrimage. Whether the history books call the group of people I am sociologically linked to the &ldquo;greatest generation&rdquo; or the &ldquo;generation-to-take-a-million-duck-face-mirror-selfies-with-a-flashlight&rdquo; does not matter &ndash; the fact remains that pilgrimage has a certain calling. And it called me.</p>
						<p>I am standing at the tip of Cabo Finisterre, which 1,000 years ago was considered the most western point in the world...for the people there it was the end of the world. An awesome moment, indeed!</p>
						<p>I am a junior at Eureka College and a fellow in the Disciples Leadership Program. Among the benefits that the fellowship gifts me are two ministry experiences anywhere in the world. I decided to unite my major (philosophy and religion) with my minor (Spanish) and undertake the Camino de Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain last summer.</p>
						<p>I knew that the process of the pilgrimage had the power to change my life in drastic ways. I underestimated just how much I needed changing. After walking over 500 miles, getting blisters on nine of my toes (gracias a Dios that the 10th was spared), and seeing more of a country in 35 days than I could ever see from a bus window, I realized that I, like millions of pilgrims before me, had epiphanies and revelations about my life, including:</p>
						<ul class="no-bullet">
							<li>I needed to live with less guilt and fewer material things.</li>
							<li>My spiritual being needed more time for expression, and more than anything I decided that I had to stop worshipping busyness. Worshipping busyness is a veritable addiction that I am still trying to work through, four months post-pilgrimage.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Eureka College sent me on a life-changing experience of which I could not immediately and accurately guess the implications. I highly doubted this could go on a resume, and I certainly had no clue what I would learn. However &ndash; and this is the beauty of Eureka College &ndash; I was allowed to go because exploration and knowing is at the heart of the liberal arts experience.</p>
						<p>I walked 15 or more miles a day for five weeks. I got to know myself in a way that I never had before. During those long days of nothing but walking, I had to finally slow down and live for the sake of living. Often in education we become encapsulated with the idea that we have to know &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; Through this opportunity I was able to know me. Eureka College not only encourages me to pick a major that might bring home the bacon (although that is a perk) but also insists that students who walk &lsquo;neath the elms know themselves. I fully believe that there is no greater gift that an institution can give to the community of learners than the vow to educate in this significant way.</p>

					<div id="panel-london" class="content">
						<h4>London means business for Eureka College, Bradley University students</h4>
						<h5>by Michele Lehman</h5>
						<p>Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace are among landmarks tourists flock to see when visiting London. But Eureka College and Bradley University students and professors were more excited about visiting less-popular sites when they made their trip across the Atlantic last spring.</p>
						<p>&quot;The students&#39; No. 1 favorite was Lloyd&#39;s of London,&quot; said Eureka College associate professor of business administration Marge Rubash, who helped organize the trip for business students. Lloyd&#39;s, the 325-year-old insurance pioneer, is the world&#39;s leading market for specialist insurance, and the students &quot;could visualize themselves working there with careers in risk management,&quot; Rubash said. On a private tour, students learned about the roles of the underwriters who were working as the group walked through the building. Several students inquired about internships, which are available on a very competitive basis, Rubash added.</p>
						<p>A visit to the Bank of England also was high on the list for the business- and finance-minded scholars, who also enjoyed teatime at The Ritz, the U.S. Embassy, Parliament, the British Museum, a theater production and Greenwich, where they stood with one foot on either side of the International Date Line.</p>
						<p>&quot;We always had a purpose for visiting each site on this trip, which was educational, with an experiential approach,&quot; said Rubash, who is coordinator of the college&#39;s International Studies Program. &quot;We met for class every day and then when out to explore the various locations.&quot;</p>
						<p>It was the perfect balance of class time and exploring, according to senior business administration and accounting major Megan Huette. &quot;I&#39;ve never been out of the United States before, so having the opportunity to experience a different culture was amazing.&quot; The highlight of her trip, Huette said, was The Ritz, where the students experienced traditional British teatime. &quot;We really got to experience the culture, dressing up, enjoying high tea and just discussing our experiences so far. For all of the students, it was something we&#39;ll never forget.&quot;</p>
						<p>While fun, trips abroad also benefit participants as students and as future employees, Rubash said. &quot;Study abroad always broadens horizons, and often students report that they learned more about themselves while traveling. And, in today&#39;s world, most employees will need experiences beyond their home state in order to grow and prosper in the business sector.&quot;</p>
						<p>Huette concurs: &quot;This trip benefited me as a student because I can now talk about my experiences and relate them to subjects we discuss in class. Also, as a future employee it will be an asset because I&#39;ve experienced adapting to different cultures and had to get along with others in an unfamiliar country.&quot;</p>
						<p>By partnering with Bradley University the group gained access to some sites, like Lloyd&#39;s, which sets a minimum number for a tour. Another benefit of the partnership: &quot;New friendships were made, and we all learned from each other,&quot; Rubash said.</p>
						<p>The trip will be offered again May 22&ndash;June 6 for $4,100 for three credit hours. Scholarships are available for the first seven to register.</p>
						<p>Another upcoming study abroad opportunity will be a Shakespeare-themed trip to England March 8&ndash;15, during spring break. Led by associate professor of English Jessica Barr and associate professor of theater Holly Rocke, highlights will include theater productions, acting workshops and tours of theaters and sites associated with renowned authors. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/arts">www.eureka.edu/arts.</a></p>
						<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased to offer these learning experiences, and there is an increasing demand for them,&quot; Rubash said.</p>
						<p>Huette added: &quot;I would like to see Eureka College do trips like these more often. I know some people in our group were skeptical about going at first, but I know we would all do it again in a second. These types of trips are perfect for people who want to study abroad but don&#39;t want to go for a long period of time or spend a lot of money.&quot;</p>
						<p>Last year alone, EC students studied abroad and completed internships and mentorships in 21 countries and 13 states.</p>
