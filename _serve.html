				<p>“The genuine, heartfelt servant leadership seen during times of crisis is perhaps among Eureka College’s finest attributes,” said  President J. David Arnold.</p>
				
				<p>In the aftermath of the tornadoes, the college community served others in many ways, including:</p>
				
				<ul class="circle">
					<li>Several commuter students and one alumnus who were displaced by the tornadoes lived in the residence halls. In total, one residential student and 10 commuter students lost their homes. Residential students reached out to help the commuter students in many ways, especially providing supplies needed for classes, including textbooks, notebooks and other essentials.</li>
					<li>The college provided housing in the residence halls for volunteer groups from across the country as they worked on clean-up efforts. The volunteers were with the NECHAMA Jewish relief organization based in Minneapolis-St. Paul, AmeriCorps and All Hands.</li>
					<li>Students in the Greek Council spearheaded a supplies drive and delivered truckloads of supplies to donation sites.</li>	
					<li>Senior Rachel Tapp of Indianapolis, a religion and philosophy major, was the guest preacher at Eureka Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Nov. 17, and just as she was about to begin her sermon, the tornado warning was issued. She helped parishioners find shelter in the basement and then kept the service going, delivering her sermon.</li>
					<li>Athletics personnel made arrangements for the Washington Community High School football team to use Eureka College facilities for practices as the team prepared for the playoff games.</li>
					<li>Eureka College alumni performed in a tornado relief benefit concert by the Peoria Symphony Orchestra and the Peoria Area Civic Chorale at the Peoria Civic Center Nov. 26.</li>
					<li>The Eureka College Bookstore sold a nature photo 2014 calendar by Peg Toliver, with proceeds going toward tornado relief.  The bookstore also took orders for “Washington Strong” T-shirts.</li>
					<li>Faculty, staff and students volunteered regularly to clear debris in the fields and neighborhoods around tornado sites.</li>
					<li>Student organizations continue to make plans for long-term recovery support, discussing plans for spring break projects in March to support the rebuilding efforts throughout the region.</li>
					<li>The college organized a tornado relief fund, with donations going to the American Red Cross.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>“Many people in the campus community have given of their time, talents and funds to assist in the aftermath of the tornadoes,” Arnold said. “We know that the outpouring of support from the Eureka College family will be ongoing, as the relief efforts will be long and will require sustained, concerted efforts.”</p>

				<p>Professors, staff and students were in a dunk tank, with proceeds going to the Roanoke Flood Relief Fund to aid victims of recent flooding in Roanoke. </p>
				
				<p>Other activities included pies in the faces of residence hall assistants, an inflatable bounce house, cotton candy, snow cones, dinner outdoors, crafts and music. The Final Say band  performed  and the film “Space Jam” was shown on a large inflatable screen after sunset. </p>

				<p>For the fifth straight year, Eureka College students held a community service day to provide Eureka residents with free spring cleanup help.  The Maroon and Golden Rule project was held from 9:30 a.m. to noon April 20.</p>
				
				<p>The project stemmed from a grant received by Eureka College in 2009 from Illinois Campus Compact to promote leadership and citizenship. The grant covered the cost of launching the project.</p>				
				<p>"We strongly encourage Eureka citizens and non-profit organizations to submit a project, since our students are ready to serve,” said Colton Lott and Jenelle Chapman, co-chairpersons of this year’s project.  “Students truly look forward to this opportunity to give back to the Eureka community that we call home for nine months."</p>
				<p>Since its inception, approximately 230 students have assisted more than 60 residents and organizations with projects, including paving blacktop, moving furniture, painting, yard work and spring cleaning. </p>
