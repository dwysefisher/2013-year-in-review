				<h3 class="first-paragraph"> Leadership has been a central precept of the Eureka College culture since our inception in 1855. Leadership education incorporated into student learning is foundational to the Eureka experience. Similarly, we believe our institution plays a significant leadership role in the community, region and nation and we work to ensure that decisions made by our Administration and Board of Trustees provide continued leadership to the industry of higher education.</h3>

			<h3 class="first-paragraph subheader">The Board of Trustees voted to freeze tuition and fees at this year’s rates for next academic year. The freeze applies to current and incoming students.</h3>
			
			<p>“Illinois’ recession was more severe than the nation’s as a whole, and our immediate region’s economic recovery has been occurring more slowly,” said Eureka College President J. David Arnold, citing information from Moody’s 2013 Economic Forecast. “Since a large portion of Eureka College students are from Illinois and they are dealing with this economic reality, we are committing to a partnership with our students and their families to ensure their college experience remains affordable and accessible,” Arnold said.</p>

							<p><a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/tuition-fees/">Tuition for full-time students</a> in fall 2014 will be $10,030 per semester or $20,060 for the academic year. For most students, the cost is reduced through institutional aid as well as state and federal educational grants. Incoming freshmen receive an average of $15,000 to $18,000 in financial aid, which greatly reduces the cost to attend. This is the second time in the last 10 years that the college has frozen tuition.</p>
							
							<p>“Eureka College has always been committed to keeping our exceptional educational experience affordable and accessible,” said Dean of Admissions Kurt Krile. “Since our founding in 1855, the college has consistently offered some of the lowest tuition rates among Illinois private colleges. This focus allows us to provide a private, liberal arts education to a diverse student base, including first-generation students, which improves the educational and economic capacity of our state.”</p>
							
							<p>In addition to the tuition freeze, the college has developed a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/scholarships">new institutional aid process</a> in an effort to provide a straightforward approach for students and their families. Academic scholarships are now calculated based on two categories: a student’s high school grade point average and their ACT exam score. Additional scholarships, called engagement awards, will be given to students who show excellence in areas like community service, leadership and the fine and performing arts.</p>
							
							<p>“We are being intentional about the type of student body we are creating, and by revamping our scholarship structure, we are able to better incentivize students who fit with the Eureka College ethos of learning, service and leadership,” said Director of Marketing and Communications Corrie Heck. “The continued significant investment in institutional aid and the freeze in tuition ensures that Eureka College students are graduating with a world-renowned private college education and relatively low levels of loan debt.”</p>

				<p>EC marked the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in Illinois with a commemorative program featuring music, dance, poetry, dramatic readings and stories about Eureka College alumnae who were important in the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
				<p>“Eureka College has a rich history linked to the suffrage movement, as reform-minded women and men from this institution promoted women’s voting rights both in Illinois and across the nation,” said Eureka College history professor Junius Rodriguez.</p>

							<p>The program featured two speakers who highlighted the century of progress and encourage those who will be the next generation of leaders. Annette Dyar Sherman, an alumna from the class of 1941, spoke about the tremendous expansion of opportunities for women and girls that she has witnessed in her lifetime. Rebecca “Becky” Weber of Metamora, who recently was installed as the national Director of Junior Clubs for the General Federation of Women’s Clubs International, spoke about the expanded opportunities that exist today for girls and women and the outlook for progress in the years ahead.</p>
							
							<p>The story of expanded rights for women has always been central to the story of Eureka College, Rodriguez said. Eureka College was the first school in Illinois and the third in the nation to educate women on an equal basis with men, he said.</p> 
							<p>On June 26, 1913, Gov. Edward F. Dunne signed the Illinois Municipal Voting Act into law making Illinois the first state east of the Mississippi River to allow women to vote in local and presidential elections. Many Illinois women participated in suffrage events in Washington, D.C., to gain the right for women in the rest of the country. On Aug. 26, 1920, women across the nation received the right to vote with the final ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
							
							<p>Additionally, EC Assistant Professor of History Dr. Erika Quinn joined community leaders on PBS' At Issue to discuss the anniversary of women's suffrage.</p>
